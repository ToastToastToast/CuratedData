    <h1> Artist Statement </h1>
    <p class="text-break" style="width:1000px"> This project, "NightTime Stroll", is a hunt for the night time scenery that fits the viewer. Whether its
      a favorite, the most interesting, the most beautiful, the one that fits your personality, or for any other reason it may be, its
      the discovery of the place best suited for the viewer. The location that is chosen can say something about that person.
      During the night, people lose the ability to see everything around themselves. This can create different
      emotions which one may be drawn to more lit areas or the desire to explore the dark areas. </p>
